            <p>William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616)[a] was an English playwright, poet, and actor,
                widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest
                dramatist.[2][3][4]
                He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard").[5][b] His
                extant
                works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays,[c] 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems,
                and a
                few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living
                language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[7] They also continue to be
                studied and reinterpreted.</p>
            <p>
                Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne
                Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585
                and
                1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company
                called
                the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have
                retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life
                survive;
                this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his
                sexuality,
                his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.[8][9][10]</p>
            <p>
                Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.[11][12][d] His early plays were
                primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. He
                then
                wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth,
                all
                considered to be among the finest works in the English language.[2][3][4] In the last phase of his life,
                he
                wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.</p>
            <p>
                Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime.
                However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell,
                published
                a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's
                dramatic
                works that included all but two of his plays.[13] Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson that
                hailed
                Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: "not of an age, but for all time".[13]</p>

                The letter announces Macbeth's promotion to the thaneship of Cawdor and details his meeting with the
                witches. Lady Macbeth murmurs that she knows Macbeth is ambitious, but fears he is too full of “th' milk
                of
                human kindness” to take the steps necessary to make himself king (1.5. 15). <br> <br>
